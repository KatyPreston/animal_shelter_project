# animal_shelter_project
Ruby/Sinatra/PostgreSQL project (week 5 CodeClan Course)

database name = shelter

Things I would modify:
- When delete an adoption, update the animal adopted to false again
- Improve design of navigation for user
- Admission date as a date not a string
- Improve styling/layout, mainly of the registration and edit forms

Things I would add:
- Create delete/edit/registration confirmation messages
- Add descriptions of animals and owners
- Show animals that an owner has adopted in the owner view
- Have a search form on the animal index page to search by type of animal, adoptable status etc rather than separate links
